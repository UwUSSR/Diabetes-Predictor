This project aims to predict diabetes outcomes using machine learning techniques. It employs various algorithms to classify whether a patient has diabetes based on medical features.

Project Overview
The project involves developing and evaluating different machine learning models to predict diabetes. The dataset includes features such as blood glucose levels, BMI, and age.

Features
Pregnancies: Number of pregnancies
Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration
BloodPressure: Blood pressure measurement
SkinThickness: Thickness of the skin fold
Insulin: Serum insulin levels
BMI: Body Mass Index
DiabetesPedigreeFunction: Family history of diabetes
Age: Age of the patient
Outcome: Target variable (1 for diabetes, 0 for no diabetes)
Algorithms Used
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Algorithms Used
1. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Evaluated different values for the number of neighbors.
Determined the optimal number of neighbors based on accuracy.

2. Decision Tree Classifier
Built and evaluated a Decision Tree model.
Used feature importance to understand the contribution of each feature.
Applied a depth constraint to prevent overfitting.

3. Neural Network Classifier (MLP)
Implemented a Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) model.
Compared performance with and without feature scaling.
Visualized the weight matrix to interpret the learned patterns.
